/** Simple GPIO LED flashing program - written in C++ by Derek Molloy
*    simple functional struture for the Exploring Raspberry Pi book
*
*    This program uses GPIO4 and can be executed in the following ways:
*         makeLED setup
*         makeLED on
*         makeLED off
*         makeLED status (get the LED state)
*         makeLED close
